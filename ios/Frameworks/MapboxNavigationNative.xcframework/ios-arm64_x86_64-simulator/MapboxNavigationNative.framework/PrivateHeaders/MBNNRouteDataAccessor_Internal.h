 *
 * NOT IMPLEMENTED YET (!) but should be in the future:
 * - the resulting object doesn't contain the reference to the RouteInterface object that created it. So it can be

 * - the returned snapshot contains read-only and non-modifiable data. For retrieving the data that was modified during
 * the last route refresh you should call this method again to obtain the new snapshot of the data.
